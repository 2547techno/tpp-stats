10 N users list will be updated every 1 min (can be changed)
    - logic defined in api, so no need to touch backend service to avoid downtime

total stats data:
do i cache it to be returned with each user data request?
    - since total data is cached user data is not, ratio between them will not be as accurate (does 1 min accuracy really matter? idk maybe not)
or do i call the view and return the data on each request? (no caching)
    - ratio will be more accurate but involves an extra db call each time
    - db call is heavier than normal data fetch since it sums the entire table
** i ended up caching for 1 min **

top 100 user stats:
    - is also on a 1 min cache
